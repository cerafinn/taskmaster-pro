## Usage

The web application is designed to allow users to add items to whichever list they currently belong to. The application allows for drag-and-drop movement between the lists. When Adding a task, a modal will appear that allows for users to add in a task description and due date. After the task  is created, both the date and description of the task can be clicked on to edit the task. Dragging a task to the bottom of the screen allows for a task to be deleted while the Delete All Tasks button deletes all tasks that are on the board.
